# World-Population-Data-2023-Scraping
"In this project, I have performed web scraping of World Population Data. Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. In our project, we focused on scraping World Population Data from 'www.worldometers.info' using the BeautifulSoup library, which is a popular Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files."
